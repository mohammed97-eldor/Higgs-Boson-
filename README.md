# Higgs-Boson-
This Repository is a University project in which I made a deep data analysis of the Higgs Boson dataset from the Kaggle compitition on the following link https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson. You will find an attached report of all the followed steps and a notebook having all the needed code for results and even visualizations.
There are many cells in the notebook that are not runned. The report has the results and best confgurations. If more details are needed the code is fully written and tested.
